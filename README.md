# 🎮 2D Games Launcher Project

Hi there! 👋
This is a **Python-based 2D Games Launcher** I created during my gap year between completing 12th standard and entering college.

---

## 🗂️ Project Overview

**Main Feature:**
The `main.py` file acts like a home screen, launching a dashboard (like an Android launcher) where users log in and pick from **4 different 2D games**.

**Technology Stack:**

* **Python** (5 `.py` files total)
* **Tkinter** for the launcher and 3 games
* **Turtle** for 1 game
* **MySQL** to store user data and scores

---

## 👥 User Management

* Each player logs in to their own account.
* Scores and other game details are tracked per user.
* Includes error handling and user-specific logic for better security and experience.

---

## 🗃️ Data Storage

* User scores and details are saved in a **MySQL database**.
* Data is updated and retrieved dynamically.

---

## ✅ Key Features

✔️ One launcher dashboard for all 4 games — just like a home app on Android OS!

✔️ Individual user profiles with saved progress

✔️ Simple, beginner-friendly Python project

✔️ GUI made with **Tkinter** and **Turtle**

✔️ Error handling for smoother gameplay

## ⚡ Getting Started

**Clone this repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```

**Install requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* `mysql-connector-python`
* `Tkinter` (usually pre-installed with Python)

**Set up your MySQL database:**

* Create a database and tables for storing user data and scores.
* Update your connection details in the code (`host`, `user`, `password`, `database`).

**Run the launcher:**

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🎓 About This Project

This project helped me practice:

* Python programming
* GUI design
* Basic 2D game development
* Database integration

I built this as my own **mini games platform** to learn how to manage multiple apps under one launcher — just like a simple operating system for fun!
